## Getting Started
This module requires Lintel.

If you haven't used [Lintel](http://lintel.io/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://lintel.io/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to install and use this module. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this module with this command:

```shell
bower install lintel-contrib-notifications --save
```

Once the module has been installed, you will have to load it in your main SASS file:

```scss
@import "bower_components/lintel-contrib-notifications/sass/notifications.scss"
```

This module also includes a JavaScript component, which you will have to load separately.

```html
<script src="bower_components/lintel-contrib-notifications/dist/notifications.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

You can use [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep) or [grunt-wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep) to automatically inject files in your build process.
